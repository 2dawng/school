Having higher quality healthcare facilities ensures that
residents in cities have access to advanced medical 
treatments and specialized care, resulting in better health 
outcomes. Similarly, improved educational institutions in 
cities offer a wide range of academic and extracurricular 
opportunities so student can develop their talents effectively.
In the meantime, in village life, disadvantages include lack of
healthcare facilities, limited access to quality education,
and insufficient resources for both.
